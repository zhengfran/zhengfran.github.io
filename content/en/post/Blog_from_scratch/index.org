* Why
** Why do I need a blog?
- to record
** Why org-mode?
As someone who has spent quit significant amount of time on configuring emacs, I have unavoidably fall in love with org-mode. Even now I do not use emacs as main editor anymore, I still use logseq ans uses org-mode to take notes and manage todos. Org-mode is the ultimate form of what text can achieve in my opinion. 

** Why hugo?
- It supports org-mode. 
- Easy to setup
  + As an embedded software engineer, my knowledge of tech stack in web is pretty limited.
  + Tutorials eveywhere
